Hello Everyone!

My name is Alexander Hernandez and I would like to introduce myself as your OpenGEE Community Manager. I’m currently employed at Thermopylae Sciences and Technology and I’m excited to be a part of this new community. At TST we’re looking forward to improving the project and working with the open source community to add the functionality that you need.

As for myself, I worked in the Defense Industry for six years and then transitioned to my current role for the past three. Outside of work you might catch me playing guitar in Dallas or out on the golf course on a sunny day.

Normally, an open source group does not get to start with such a strong code foundation. We have inherited a very useful tool from Google and it is my belief that we can find new and interesting uses for it.

If you have been following the project you might have already seen our [Slack Channel](http://slack.opengee.org) but if not then I invite you to join! It has been an active place for discussion and I will do what I can to keep it that way. It is my belief that we should keep the development as open and developer friendly as possible and Slack provides us a good means to do so.

In the future, I want to continue to use this blog as a place to talk about new features, contributors, product releases and representing OpenGEE at conferences. If you have any question about OpenGEE, myself or the future of the project please do not hesitate to email me: <ahernandez@t-sciences.com>.

Until then, see you in Slack!

-Alex
